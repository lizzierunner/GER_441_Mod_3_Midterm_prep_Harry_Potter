### 📌 Core Concepts

**Princess as Reward (Lin)**
- Marriage = ultimate reward in traditional fairy tales
- Cinderella suffers → gets prince
- HP shifts reward to belonging/identity

**Archetype vs. Stereotype**
- Archetype = universal pattern, narrative-driven
- Stereotype = rigid cultural expectation, limits complexity
- Disney Cinderella: kindness/beauty/patience become requirements

**Power Types**
- Dumbledore = wisdom, benevolent, trust
- Voldemort = destructive, fear-based, no boundaries
- Snape = deception, secrecy, complexity

**Agency Spectrum**
- STRONGEST: Harry Potter (Hermione drives plot)
- MIDDLE: 2015 Cinderella (emotional agency)
- WEAKEST: 1950 Cinderella (passive rescue)

- **Belonging** - Finding community and home (Harry at Hogwarts)
- **Identity Crisis** - Harry's journey from outcast to wizard

## 🎬 Key Scenes to Reference

- Ball scene: Prince chooses her based on appearance
- Shoe fitting: Recognition, not action

- "Have courage and be kind" - emotional depth
- Ball scene: Conversation, connection
- Still relies on recognition + marriage

**Harry Potter**
- Hogwarts letter: Call to identity/belonging
- Sorting Hat: Community over romance
- Devil's Snare: Hermione solves it (active agency)
- Mirror of Erised: Desire for family, not romance
- Final battle: Teamwork, not rescue

---

## 🌟 Hermione = Your Best Example

Use Hermione to show:
- **Knowledge** drives plot forward
- **Decision-making** saves characters
- **Agency** without romance subplot
- **Intelligence** valued over beauty
- **Action** replaces waiting/suffering

Specific Examples:
- Solves Devil's Snare puzzle
- Figures out the Basilisk
- Makes the Polyjuice Potion
- Punches Malfoy
- Saves Sirius and Buckbeak
