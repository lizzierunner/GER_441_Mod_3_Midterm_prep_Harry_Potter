## 🔥 MUST-KNOW Concepts

### Lin's "Princess as Reward"
**Definition:** Marriage to the prince is the ultimate reward for the heroine's suffering and virtue.

**Apply to Cinderella:**
- Grimm (1812): Suffering → Marriage → Happily Ever After
- Disney 1950: Beauty + Kindness → Recognition → Prince
- 2015 Live Action: More depth, but still ends with marriage

**Apply to Harry Potter:**
- REWARD SHIFTS: Romance → Belonging & Identity
- Harry wants family, not princess
- Hogwarts = home, friends = reward

## 📖 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Archetype** | Universal pattern, narrative-driven | Hero's journey, wise mentor |
| **Stereotype** | Rigid cultural expectation | "Princesses must be beautiful" |
| **Agency** | Character's choices affect outcome | Hermione solving puzzles |
| **Passive Rescue** | Being saved without action | Cinderella waiting for prince |
| **Active Rescue** | Taking action to save self/others | HP trio fighting Voldemort |

## 💪 Agency Ranking (MEMORIZE THIS!)

**STRONGEST → WEAKEST:**

1. **Harry Potter** (Active)
   - Hermione makes decisions that drive plot
   - Teamwork and problem-solving
   - Actions have consequences

2. **Cinderella 2015** (Emotional Agency)
   - Makes emotional choices
   - "Have courage and be kind"
   - Still depends on recognition

3. **Cinderella 1950** (Passive)
   - Waits to be rescued
   - No active choices
   - Recognition is everything

## 🌟 Last-Minute Mantras

**Repeat 3 times before exam:**

1. "Compare ALL versions: Grimm, 1950, 2015, HP"
2. "Hermione is my female agency example"
3. "Cite specific scenes, not vague ideas"
4. "Structure matters: Intro → Evidence → Analysis → Conclusion"
5. "HP shifts reward from romance to belonging"

---

## 🎯 If You Only Remember 3 Things:

### 1. Lin's Framework
Princess as reward = marriage is ultimate goal
HP breaks this by making reward = belonging

### 2. Agency Spectrum
HP (active) > 2015 (emotional) > 1950 (passive)
USE HERMIONE AS YOUR EXAMPLE!

### 3. Compare Don't Just Describe
Don't just say what happens
Say how it's DIFFERENT and what that MEANS
